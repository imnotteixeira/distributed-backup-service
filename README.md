# Distributed Backup Service
Developed as a second project on the *Distributed Systems* Curricular Unit of 2018. Faculdade de Engenharia da Universidade do Porto.

## Description
This project uses TCP Secure Java Sockets (JSSE) to implement the [Chord Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_(peer-to-peer)) and achieve a dynamic distributed system, capable of redundantly storing files (divided in chunks) across multiple machines. It allows for *FILE BACKUP*, *FILE RETRIEVAL*, *STATUS CHECK*, *UPDATE PEER'S ALLOCATED SPACE*, *FILE DELETION*, *ADD PEER* and more.
